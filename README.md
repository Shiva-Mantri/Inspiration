### Side Projects
#### Things to consider
- It takes time to do side projects. Think - managing two projects at your work. If you can manage 2 projects at work, without affecting your work life balance (if you care about it), then Side Project is for you. 
- A few alternate ways - Start small, outsource/delegate, find passive income
- Clearly understand importance of Survivorship Bias. Read ['What survivorship bias is and how to avoid falling prey to it'](https://www.deanyeong.com/article/survivorship-bias). On the otherside, do NOT let this discourage you, but be aware of road ahead.
